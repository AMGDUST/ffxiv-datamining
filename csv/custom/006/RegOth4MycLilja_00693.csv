0,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_000","I had a talk with Jessie, and convinced her to let me stay on here at the southern front! Isn't that great?"
1,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_001","Not sure what help I can be to an accomplished hero such as yourself, but if you need anything─anything at all─don't hesitate to ask."
2,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_002","On that note, is there anything I can do for you now?"
3,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_005","Please, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. You have to save Mikoto... Gods, I still can't understand why Misija would do this."
4,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_010","Thank goodness Mikoto was okay. No time to relax, though. Not as long as the IVth Legion is still out there up to no good."
5,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_011","Anything you need before I get back to work?"
6,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_015","Mikoto kept insisting on helping with my work around here, but I wouldn't hear of it. She has enough on her mind as it is helping contend with the imperials and Queen Gunnhildr."
7,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_016","As a matter of fact, I've been trying to take more work off her hands when I can. Anything to help you and Mikoto focus on the task at hand."
8,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_017","Speaking of which, is there anything you need?"
9,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_020","Mikoto said before that something about the summonings didn't sit right with her. Gods, I don't know what she's up to, but you have to find her!"
10,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_025","Thank the gods you're both all right. I don't know what I'd do if anything happened to you two."
11,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_026","If you need anything─anything at all─simply say the word."
12,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_030","I understand Mikoto's worried about Save the Queen─and rightfully so─but if anyone can stop Misija, it's you."
13,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_031","I'm sure you have things to do, battles to prepare for, but if you need anything, don't hesitate to ask."
14,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_035","So this is it, then? You and the others are off? I wish I could go with you, but goodness knows I'd only slow you down. Good luck, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
15,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_040","Hah, I knew it. Even with Save the Queen, Misija never stood a chance against you. <sniffle> Sorry. Something's in my eye."
16,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_041","Did you need something, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
17,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_Q30_000_000","What will you say?"
18,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_A30_000_000","Tell me about the aether spectrometer."
19,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_A30_000_001","Tell me about the recording drone."
20,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_A30_000_002","Tell me about yourself."
21,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_A30_000_0010","Nothing."
22,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_000","The aether spectrometer? Well, seeing as I haven't read the manual, you'll have to settle for a brief explanation. Just promise not to tell Jessie, okay?"
23,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_001","Ahem. The idea for it originally came from Mikoto, and the chief─genius that he is─was able to put her ideas to paper. After that, all it took was a little ingenuity from our engineers to bring everything together."
24,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_002","After the sensors are in place and turned on, they analyze the aether currents running through the area, and that data is tracked by our monitors here."
25,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_003","What makes it so invaluable to our plans is its ability to distinguish between varying aetherial signatures. The large aether currents we're tracking are like giant rivers fed by streams of different kinds of aether. But with the spectrometer, we can easily pick out the specific one we need. Fascinating stuff, isn't it?"
26,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_100","The what? Oh, right. The chief picked it up on one of his scavenging trips to Allagan ruins somewhere. It's been surprisingly nice to have around. Goodness knows I can't keep track of everything going on here."
27,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_101","Jessie asked that I keep it on at all times. Between you and me, though, I think she just wants to keep a close eye on me. Whether that's a good or a bad thing, I'm not sure."
28,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_200","M-Me!? But I... Why would you want to know about me?"
29,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_201","Can't imagine we have many common interests. I'd make for terrible company, what with you being the savior of Eorzea, while I'm just a... Oh gods..."
30,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_SYSTEM_100_202","As Lilja's face begins to turn red, her speech becomes increasingly incoherent. You think it best to leave her be."
